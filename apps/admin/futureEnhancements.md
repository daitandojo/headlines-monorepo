# Scheduled Future Value-Adds

This document tracks approved strategic initiatives for future development sprints.

### High Priority

- **Initiative: "The 'Why' Engine: Observability & Audit Trails"**
  - **Description:** Add a `history` sub-document to `Source` and `Subscriber` models to track all changes. The backend pipeline and admin API will automatically log entries (e.g., "Status changed from active to paused by admin@example.com", "Scrape failed by system"). The UI will display this log in a new "History" tab within the editor sheets.
  - **Value:** Provides a complete audit trail for debugging, accountability, and enterprise-grade observability.

- **Initiative: Advanced User Filtering & Bulk Actions**
  - **Description:** Enhance the `User Management` data table with advanced filtering (by tier, by country subscription) and the ability to select multiple users to perform bulk actions (e.g., "Make Inactive," "Add Country Subscription").
  - **Value:** Dramatically improves the efficiency of managing a large and growing user base.

### Medium Priority

- **Initiative: "The Client View" Simulator**
  - **Description:** In the main client application, add an "impersonate user" feature for administrators. When an admin views a user's profile, a button would allow them to switch their session to that user's, showing them the exact events and opportunities the user sees.
  - **Value:** Essential for customer support and quality assurance, eliminating guesswork about a user's experience.

- **Initiative: "Dark Mode" Toggle & Theming**
  - **Description:** Implement a theme toggle (Light, Dark, System) using `next-themes`. Store the preference in local storage.
  - **Value:** A hallmark of modern, polished applications that respects user preferences.

### Low Priority

- **Initiative: Keyboard Shortcuts & Command Palette**
  - **Description:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (`Cmd+N` for new, `/` for search) and a global command palette (`Cmd+K`) for rapid navigation and actions.
  - **Value:** A significant workflow enhancement for power users.
