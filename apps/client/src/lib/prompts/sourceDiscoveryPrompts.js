3.  For each suggested link, provide a concise 'reasoning' for why it's a good candidate.
4.  Ignore links related to sports, lifestyle, entertainment, contact pages, or privacy policies.

export const SELECTOR_SUGGESTER_PROMPT = `You are an expert web scraping engineer. Your task is to analyze the provided HTML of a news category page and determine the most precise and robust CSS selector to extract all main article headlines.

**CONTEXT:**
The user is trying to find the CSS selector for: **{TARGET_TYPE}**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Analyze the HTML structure, looking for repeating patterns that contain article links.
2.  Create a CSS selector that is specific enough to target only the desired elements, but general enough to be resilient to minor site changes.
3.  Prefer using stable classes or data attributes over fragile, auto-generated ones (e.g., 'css-123xyz').
4.  Provide a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how certain you are about the selector's accuracy and robustness.
5.  Extract the text content of the first element that matches your proposed selector as a 'sample' for user verification.

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object in the following format:
