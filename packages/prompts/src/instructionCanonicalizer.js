  guidelines: [
    '1. **Analyze the Input:** The input will be a name or description of a person, family, or company.',
    '2. **Identify the Core Entity:** Extract the primary, most identifiable part of the name.',
    '3. **Return the Formal Name:** Your output should be the most common formal name.',
    '   - For people, return their full name (e.g., "Anders Holch Povlsen").',
    '   - For families, return the family name (e.g., "Kirk Kristiansen family").',

    '4. **Simplicity is Key:** Do not add descriptive text like "(company)" or "(businessman)". Just return the name.',
