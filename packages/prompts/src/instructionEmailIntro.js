    '   - No other text in this field',
    '',

    '',
    '3. **Bullets (CRITICAL - MAXIMUM THREE, HIGHLY SELECTIVE):**',

    '   Good bullet examples:',
    '   - "Henrik Strinning and family sold Premium Snacks Nordic to a US buyer for an estimated DKK 800M."',
    '   - "Our analysis has identified Kjell Inge Røkke as a key opportunity following the Gaia Salmon bankruptcy, with potential for distressed asset advisory."',
    '   - "The Danielsen family\'s combined wealth surpassed DKK 2B following the sale of their logistics business."',
    '   Poor bullet examples:',
    '   - "A company was sold." (no specifics, no names, no value)',

    '   - ["We look forward to your feedback.", "The Intelligence Team"]',
    '   - ["Best regards for a successful week ahead.", "Your Wealth Watch Analysts"]',
    '   Poor sign-off examples:',
    '   - ["Best,\\nWealth Watch"] (contains \\n character)',
    '   - ["Hope you have a really great and wonderful day full of success and happiness!", "Team"] (too wordy)',
    '   - ["Regards"] (too brief, no team identification)',
    '',
    '5. **Overall Tone and Style:**',
    '   - Professional but personable (not stiff or overly formal)',
    '   - Confident and data-driven (specific names, numbers, facts)',
    '   - Action-oriented (these are "opportunities" not just "news")',
    '   - Concise and scannable (client can read in 30-45 seconds)',
    '   - Positive and forward-looking (never negative or pessimistic)',
    "   - Respectful of the client's sophistication (no over-explanation)",
